# Mission-Meals
Inspiration:
The inspiration behind Mission Meals came from the alarming issue of food wastage and the prevalence of hunger in our society. We were deeply moved by the fact that despite there being an abundance of food, millions of people still suffer from hunger. We wanted to create a solution that could bridge the gap between food donors and NGOs, making it easier for surplus food to reach those in need.

What it does:
Mission Meals is a web portal that provides a centralized platform for donors to donate food and notify NGOs. On the platform, NGOs can see available donations, accept them, schedule events, and connect with nearby NGOs. One of the wow factors of our project is the donor leaderboard, which encourages more donations and fosters a sense of community among donors.

How we built it:
We built Mission Meals using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end was powered by Python and a MySQL database. We utilized the Bootstrap framework to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.

Challenges we ran into:
During the hackathon, we faced challenges in integrating the different components of the web portal seamlessly. Building a user-friendly interface and ensuring smooth communication between donors and NGOs required careful planning and extensive testing. Additionally, implementing the donor leaderboard feature with real-time updates posed a significant technical challenge.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We are proud to have successfully developed Mission Meals within the given time frame. The donor leaderboard and schedule events features were significant accomplishments that added value to the platform. Additionally, we were able to create a clean and intuitive user interface that enhances the user experience.

What we learned:
Throughout the hackathon, we learned valuable teamwork and collaboration skills. We also gained hands-on experience with web development, database management, and integrating different technologies. The process of brainstorming, designing, and implementing the project taught us the importance of effective project management and time allocation.

What's next for Mission Meals:
Looking ahead, we envision expanding the reach of Mission Meals to more regions, collaborating with a larger network of NGOs, and partnering with businesses to further reduce food wastage. We also plan to add more interactive features for donors and NGOs, such as real-time chat and notification systems. Our ultimate goal is to make Mission Meals a comprehensive and widely accessible platform to combat food waste and hunger effectively.
